Hi, this is my first python project, whitch allows you to scan website for potential security vulnerabilities.

It check for vulnerabilities like Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy.

in order to use this code you need to be in kali linux, and then do the command "python clickjack\ scanner.py"

PS: the idea for this project came from my experience using https://securityheaders.com/
